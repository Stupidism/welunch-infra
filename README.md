# welunch-infra

## Get Startted

1. pull latest welunch-apple image

```
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/stupidism/welunch-apple
```

2. compose it up

```
cd apple
docker-compose up
```
or directly:  

```
docker-compose -f apple/docker-compose.yml up
```


### Trouble Shooting

1. if you get this error:
```

```

You need to run `chmod +x init-letsencrypt.sh` and `sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh`, as the blog [Nginx and Letâ€™s Encrypt with Docker in Less Than 5 Minutes](https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71) says.
